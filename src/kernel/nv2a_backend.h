/*
 * NV2A render back-end interface.
 *
 * The pushbuffer executor (nv2a_pb_exec.c) decodes what a title asks the GPU
 * to do. By default it carries that out itself, on the CPU, into guest memory.
 * A game project can instead register a back end -- a D3D11 renderer, say --
 * and the executor hands it the work in already-decoded form:
 *
 *   surface state + clears, triangles (transformed to surface pixels, with
 *   per-vertex colour and texel-space UVs), the texture each batch samples,
 *   and the flip that ends a frame.
 *
 * Everything is called on the NV2A poll thread, one call at a time, so a back
 * end may create its window and device lazily on the first call and pump its
 * window messages from flip(). Wrapped by nv2a_backend_queue, it is called on
 * the queue's thread instead, still one call at a time.
 *
 * Fixed-function, pre-transformed and vertex-program batches all arrive the
 * same way: the executor transforms fixed-function vertices itself and runs
 * vertex programs on the CPU (vp_run), so a back end only ever sees surface
 * pixels. Blend, depth and alpha state arrive in Nv2aRenderState.
 *
 * ponytail: register-combiner state is not passed on. Extend Nv2aBatch when
 * it lands rather than adding callbacks.
