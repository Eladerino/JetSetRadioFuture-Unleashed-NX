/* nv2a_dk_pack.h -- the deko3d renderer's shader pack and key files, used by
 * the console (nv2a_dk.c, dk_compile.c).
 *
 * The ubershaders draw everything, but interpreting the NV2A program per
 * vertex and the combiners per pixel is slow. So each vertex program and
 * combiner setup gets a dedicated shader -- the GL renderer's generators
 * (dk_shadergen.c) with deko3d's interface (dk_gen.c), compiled by uam
 * -- kept in dk_shaders.pak, which the console loads at start and prefers
 * over the ubershaders. The console builds the pack itself (dk_compile.c,
 * uam linked in): every shader in the game's XBE on the first start, and
 * whatever a draw meets that the pack lacks, appended as it goes; until a
 * setup's shader is built, the ubershader draws it. The console also records
 * shader keys it meets in dk_keys.bin next to the NRO.
 *
 * Key file: a sequence of records, little-endian u32 words.
 *   vertex program:  'VSK1', start slot, n slots, n x 4 program words
 *                    (the slots from start through the FINAL one)
 *   combiners:       'FSK1', 37, the 37 words of an Nv2aPshKey
 *
 * Pack: 'DKPK', version 1, entry count; then per entry:
 *   u32 kind (0 vertex, 1 fragment), u32 dksh size (a multiple of 256),
 *   u64 key, the DKSH module.
 * or the generator's stamp (DK_PACK_STAMP, first): u32 2, u32 0, u64 the
 *   stamp. A reader skips kinds it does not know.
 *
 * The stamp is DK_GEN_STAMP, a hash of the generators' sources: the SHA-1s
 * of the files in DK_GEN_FILES, in that order, as hex, and the first 16 hex
 * digits of the SHA-1 of that string. A pack with another stamp, or none, was made by
 * another version of the generators -- its shaders may hold a bug since
 * fixed -- so the console builds it anew (dk_compile.c) and dk_pack starts
 * over. 0 (a build without the stamp) takes any pack.
