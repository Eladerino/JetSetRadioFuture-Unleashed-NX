"""Inline small leaf lifted functions at their direct call sites.

JSRF's game thread spends a few percent in tiny helpers: sub_0014C850 and
sub_0014C870 (an x87 max/min of two floats, 1.1% and 1.3% of the thread in
their own bodies) and sub_0014C690 (cvtss2si, 1.1%), and as much again in
what calling them costs: the caller stores its registers to the register
block, pushes the return address, calls; the callee loads the registers,
does one or two instructions' work, stores them back and returns; the caller
loads them again. Inlined, the work happens on the caller's own locals.

Runs on generated C that jsrf_reg_locals.py has rewritten. A callee is
inlined when:
  - it makes no call that needs its registers stored (nothing wrapped in
    RECOMP_RL_SPILL ... RECOMP_RL_RELOAD), no tail jump, no setjmp;
  - every goto in it is to one of its own labels, and every return is
    `esp += N; { RECOMP_RL_SPILL return; }` on a line of its own;
  - it defines no macro but the x87 ones every function gets;
  - it has at most MAX_STATEMENTS statements (HOT_STATEMENTS for the
    functions in HOT, which the console's profile found hot), not counting
    labels and the flag snapshots' declarations.
A call site `{ RECOMP_RL_SPILL RECOMP_ABI_CALL(0x<va>u, sub_<va>); RECOMP_RL_RELOAD }`
becomes `{ /* sub_<va> inlined */ RECOMP_PREEMPT(); <statements> }`, on the
same line, when the caller has a local for every register the callee uses
(and the x87 top, if it uses that):
  - Straight-line, with one return at the end, the labels are left out.
  - Otherwise each label is renamed for the site (loc_X_i<return address>),
    and each return becomes a jump to sub_<va>_end<return address> at the
    end of the block.
The callee's own locals (flag snapshots, ebp) are declared again inside the
block, so the caller's are untouched, as they were across the call. The
return address is still pushed and popped: the guest stack holds the same
bytes afterwards. RECOMP_PREEMPT stays, so a guest-lock build has the same
preemption points. The callee itself stays, for indirect calls.

  python3 regen/jsrf_inline_leaves.py <gen dir>            # report only
  python3 regen/jsrf_inline_leaves.py <gen dir> --apply    # rewrite in place
  python3 regen/jsrf_inline_leaves.py <gen dir> --list     # the callees, one a line

Idempotent: an inlined site no longer has the call, and a function with an
inlined site is not inlined itself, so a second run finds nothing to do. On a
tree the first version (straight-line, 12 statements) rewrote, it inlines
the rest; that first version's sites read the same in both.
