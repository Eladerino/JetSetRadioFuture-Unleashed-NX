"""Give the lifted JSRF code the guest lock's preemption points.

NFSU2's translator puts RECOMP_PREEMPT() at the entry of every lifted
function, and xboxrecomp's --back-edge-yield (v0.15) puts one before every
loop back edge. JSRF's generated code came from jsrf-recomp's lifter, which
emits neither, so with RECOMP_GIL=1 a thread that spins on another guest
thread's flag never lets that thread run: the deadlock behind RECOMP_GIL=0.

This pass adds both, on the generated C text, so the hand edits in gen/
survive (no regeneration):

  - entry:      RECOMP_PREEMPT(); as the first statement of each lifted
                function (`void <name>(void)` followed by `{`);
  - back edges: every `goto loc_X;` whose label appears earlier in the same
                function becomes `{ RECOMP_PREEMPT(); goto loc_X; }`. Every
                cycle in a function has at least one such edge, because a
                fall-through only runs forward in the text.

Edges the spin-hint pass already marked (RECOMP_SPIN_HINT, which yields every
64 turns) are left alone.

RECOMP_PREEMPT() is the toolkit's: one load of g_gil_contended, which only the
guest lock ever sets, so with RECOMP_GIL=0 it is a branch never taken.
recomp_preempt() (kernel_bridge.c) does nothing in ISRs, DPCs or code at
DISPATCH. The macro block is pasted after the recomp_funcs.h include, guarded,
so a definition already made by recomp_types.h (included through it) wins.

  python3 regen/jsrf_preempt.py jsrf-switch/src/recomp/gen --apply   # rewrite
  python3 regen/jsrf_preempt.py jsrf-switch/src/recomp/gen --entry-only --apply

Idempotent: a file that already has the marker is skipped.
